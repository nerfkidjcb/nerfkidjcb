# Hi there! 

Nice to see you :) 

## Check Out My Website
I have a [website](https://joebroughton.tech). You'll find additional stuff about my projects and achievements there.

## Service Monitor
My new open-source repo/toolkit called [Service Monitor](https://github.com/nerfkidjcb/ServiceMonitor). This tool enables me to monitor uptime and resources locally. 

## Electric Trains
I love Factorio, and I like trains, so I built a mod. Check it out [here](https://github.com/nerfkidjcb/electric-trains).
